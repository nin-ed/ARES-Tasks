# ARES-Tasks

## Basic Image Processing Concepts implemented using OpenCV that consists of :

1. Geometric Transformations of images - (a) Scaling (b) Translation (c) Rotation (d) Perspective Transformation

2. Implementing the functioning of a mask which convolves over an image.

3. Smoothening and Sharpening of images.

4. Edge Detection in an image. (Used Canny Edge Detection)

5. Dilation, Erosion, Closing and Opening based image morphology.

6. Face Detection in an image using Haar Cascades.


## NOTE
All tasks has an included docx file which is the output to the code. One GIF has also been included in Task 1.4.
