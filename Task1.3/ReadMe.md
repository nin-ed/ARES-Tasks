## Sharpening

In this, a kernel of size 3 has been declared and is passed into the function function filter2D with the depth -1.

## Smoothening

In this, all four types has been demonstrated with the above three having a kernel size of 5. In gaussian filter, standard deviation has been declared as 0, so as to be set in accordance with the kernel size.

In bilateral filter, aperture size (diameter) is declared 10 and, sigmaColor and sigmaSpace has been kept equal having value 110.
