In all cases, a rectangular kernel has been implemented in accordance to their channels i.e. kernel of respective channel x channel.

## Erosion

It erodes away all the boundaries of foreground objects.

## Dilation

It fixes the uncommon boundaries (fills the rough boundaries and makes them smooth). In this, process we can see out forground's object appear to be having greater area.

## Closing

It is dilation followed by erosion.

## Opening

It is erosion followed by dilation which is helpful in closing small holes outside foreground.
